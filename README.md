# Hi, I'm Jasmina Buresch :)

I am an Economics Master's student at Fordham University and I have a passion for data-driven solutions to real world challenges!

Future projects I hope to work on:
- modeling monetary policy shocks on output, interest rates and unemployment using VARs 
- using AEJ data and converting Stata do files into analysis in R and Python
- automating memo writing using R Markdown, LaTex or a combo fo the two
