# Hi, I'm Jasmina Buresch :notes: :cherry_blossom: 

I am an Economics Master's student at Fordham University, and I'm having fun exploring the intersection of my econ knowledge and data science for intuitive solutions to real world challenges!

Future projects I hope to work on:
- time series forecasts on macro variables
- modeling monetary policy shocks on output, interest rates and unemployment using VARs 
- microeconometric analyses of causal relationships
- using AEJ data and converting Stata do files into analysis in R and Python
- automating memo writing using R Markdown, LaTex or a combo fo the two
